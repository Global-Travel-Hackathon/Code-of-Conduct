[Global Travel Hackathon](https://hack.travel) is an event organized by [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/), intended to hack travel and make it smarter, sustainable and accessible for everyone.

We value the participation of each member and we want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, mentors, organizers, and volunteers at any Kiwi.com event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being kind to others
* Behaving professionally

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at event venues, including but not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
